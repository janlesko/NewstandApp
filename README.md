# README

Codeacademy project: App built in rails that contain news articles with user registration system.

To dos:

* After a user is logged in, she shouldn't be able to see the signup page (http://localhost:4001/signup) or the login page (http://localhost:4001/login). Instead if she tries to visit either page, she should get redirected to the articles index page (http://localhost:4001/). Similar to how we required logged in users to view individual articles, require logged out users to view the signup and login pages.

* Add a profile page that shows the current user's first name, last name and email. Require that a user be logged in to access the profile page. Also, update the nav items to show a "Profile" link if a user is logged in.

* Let a logged in user modify her profile page. In other words, let the current user edit and update her first name, last name, and email through the profile page.

* Implement article edit function
